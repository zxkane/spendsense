## Reminder: Design Canvas (Step 1)

You're committing on feature branch '$current_branch' but no design canvas was found.

### Per CLAUDE.md Step 1, before implementation:
1. **Create design canvas**: \`docs/designs/<feature>.md\`
   - Document the feature architecture
   - Define data flows and API design
   - Include UI mockups if applicable

2. **After creating design**:
   Mark as complete:
   \`\`\`bash
   .claude/hooks/state-manager.sh mark design-canvas
   \`\`\`

### Skip Conditions:
- Bug fix (use fix/ or hotfix/ branch prefix)
- Minor refactoring
- Documentation-only changes

**This is a reminder - commit will proceed.**
